Tower Of Hanoi
Tower Of Hanoi is a Project with a main aim is to develop the puzzle TOWER OF
HANOI using graphics to develop a suitable graphics package. The objective of the puzzle
is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules ,Only one disk may
be moved at a time, Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and
sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that
rod, No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk , The entire implementation of the
puzzle is viewed in different lighting modes.

Creating an interactive program like Tower of Hanoi was a very interesting
experience. Using the two different APIâ€™s was a very useful part of the program's success
.The Tower of Hanoi is an interactive 3D program. OpenGL has given us the capability to
easily create the CONE and TORUS and position them in their respective positions. The
Tower of Hanoi application has demonstrated howa user's input can be processed at a very
fast speed and re-displayed on the screen.
